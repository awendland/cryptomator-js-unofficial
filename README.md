# Cryptomator JS (Unofficial)

An unofficial, partial implementation of [Cryptomator's](https://cryptomator.org/) [cryptofs](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs). Goal: make me familiar enough with Cryptomator's format so I feel comfortable with it as an encryption mechanism in my infrequently accessed, long-term backups.
